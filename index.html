		<p>Doctor Manhattan could very well be the first human to become a god. He was originally Jon Osterman, a physicist with a normal life before he suffered a terrible accident in his lab that seemingly disintegrated his body. But just a short time later, he returned to Earth transformed into Doctor Manhattan, an omniscient being who can see past, present and future at the same time. This ability to see all of time at once causes him to start to withdraw from humanity.</p>
